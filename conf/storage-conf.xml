         your tokens equally along the key distribution space will spread
         keys evenly across your cluster.)  This setting is only checked the

         has been fsynced to disk.  It will wait up to CommitLogSyncBatchWindowInMS
         milliseconds for other writes, before performing the sync.

         This is less necessary in Cassandra
         than in traditional databases since replication reduces the
         odds of losing data from a failure after writing the log
         entry but before it actually reaches the disk.  So the other
         option is "timed," where wirtes may be acked immediately
         and the CommitLog is simply synced every CommitLogSyncPeriodInMS
         milliseconds.

         you are frequently scheduling a second sync while the first

         entries may be written before fsync in batch mode.  This will increase
         latency slightly, but can vastly improve throughput where
         there are many writers.  Set to zero to disable
         (each entry will be synced individually).
	 Reasonable values range from a minimal 0.1 to 10 or even more
