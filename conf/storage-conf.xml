         There is an implicit table named 'system' for Cassandra internals.

    <!-- Partitioner: any IPartitioner may be used, including your own

         Cassandra provides
         org.apache.cassandra.dht.RandomPartitioner and
         org.apache.cassandra.dht.OrderPreservingPartitioner.
         Range queries require using OrderPreservingPartitioner or a subclass.

         Achtung!  Changing this parameter requires wiping your data directories,
         since the partitioner can modify the sstable on-disk format.

    <!-- If you are using the OrderPreservingPartitioner and you know your key
         distribution, you can specify the token for this node to use.
         (Keys are sent to the node with the "closest" token, so distributing
         your tokens equally along the key distribution space will spread
         keys evenly across your cluster.)  This setting is only checked the
         first time a node is started. 

         This can also be useful with RandomPartitioner to force equal
         spacing of tokens around the hash space, especially for
         clusters with a small number of nodes. -->
